# ecommerce

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

I created an ecommerce with a user-friendly e-commerce product listing page using Flutter. The 
app allow users to browse through products, apply filters (e.g., category, price range), sort 
products based on different criteria, and support pagination for smooth navigation through the 
product catalog. You will need to navigate to "See all" to be able to use the filter from the 
home page of the ecommerce app.
